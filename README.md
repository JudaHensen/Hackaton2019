# Hackaton 2019
*Proud winner of Hackaton Climate Change - MediaCollege 2019.*

The goal of this project was to create a game or application to make people aware of climate change.

To achieve this our team created a game in which all choices have an impact on the climate in one way or another.

Each member of our team created their own forking paths with possible choices, we worked together on a couple of paths which intertwine.
After everyone made their forking paths we wrote it all out in text, and then added it to the JSON file which contains all the choices and outcomes. The game reads the current choice, and searches for the next outcome with set of choices within the parsed JSON object.

To enhance the users immersion I also wrote background music and created custom sprites to see the effects on the climate.
